### Breif About Me

I am continuously working on Web development and android application development, I am highly interested in contributing into an open source project.

I like to do projects. You can see my projects
  - [RideShare](https://github.com/Jd-rathod/RideShare-Webapp) (WebApp)
  - [DocScanner](https://github.com/Jd-rathod/DocumentScanner) (Android app using Flutter)

I love to do competitive coding and participate in coding competitions.

## BackGround Information

I am familiar with python, C++, Php, HTML, CSS, Javascript, BootStrap, Angular Js, Node Js (I used it for database integration in RideShare), jQuery, Flutter and DBMS also.

I've found OWASP projects very interesting and I chose this project because I believe that I perfectly match the requirements for the project. I have knowledge of AWS as well.
In AWS I do not have in depth knowledge but I am willing to work on it and improve my skills.

## Project Proposal

I want to contribute to the project by working on ongoing issues like [#1491](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/issues/1491).

I want to make web interface more user friendly as well as good using web developement skills I have.

many modules in [src](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/tree/master/frontend/src) have not been modified, I am willing to work on it and make possible updates.

I am studing the code and trying to figure out which things are needed to be done and how I can do that.

## Questions

> What do you want to achieve?

I want to contribute as much as I can to the project. During this internship, I intend to have add/update all necessary modules and improve Web Interface of the project.

> What makes you suited to carry the project?

I have good experience with Web development as well as App development. I would be suited for this project since these skills would be essential in expanding the project.

> How much time do you plan to invest in the project before, during and after the Summer of Code?

I plan to invest approx 4-5 hours everyday during the coding period. I will also interact and discuss ideas during the Community bonding period. I intend to continue contributing to the project after Summer of Code, since I found it very interesting.

## Timeline

### Community Bonding

I will try to be familier with the codebase and get knowledge about current status of project. Spend time interacting with community members and learn more about current status of project. The period can also be used to further refine, discuss and plan the components of proposal which are not very clear.

### Coding Phase

I will contribute code regarding task which I have assigned/taken and try to improve it at my best.

> June 7 - July 12
  - Discussion on ongoing issues and updates in the modules which can be done.
  - Start working on them.
  - Testing the overall working of each and every module of the modified source code
